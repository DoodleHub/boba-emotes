      <p>Welcome to Boba Emotes! Thanks for stopping by!</p>
      <p>
        This is the official page for my sticker pack, Boba Emotes. I started
        creating these stickers as a fun, creative project in my free time while
        also exploring the iOS ecosystem. I hope these stickers bring a little
        joy to your day! If people enjoy them, Iâ€™d love to keep creating more.
        Thank you for visiting, and I hope you have fun using them!
